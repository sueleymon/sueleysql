In my role as a data analyst at Rockbuster Stealth LLC, I had the task of facilitating the company's transition into the digital era. Rockbuster Stealth, a movie rental company that is facing fierce competition from streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, desired to leverage the existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service.

Key Questions and Objectives

1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

To address these questions, I used SQL which allowed me to extract insights from the data and answer progressively complex business queries.  The primary objective was to provide me with hands-on experience in SQL.
By the conclusion of this project, I had acquired the ability to utilize SQL for a wide range of analytical tasks, providing valuable data-driven insights for diverse clients and industries.
