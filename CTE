Here are two SQL queries with common table expressions:

First:

WITH average_amount_paid_top_5_cte(customer_id,first_name,last_name,country,city, total_amount_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(A.amount) as total_amount_paid
    FROM payment A
    INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
    WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city
 	ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
	LIMIT 5) 
	SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average
	from average_amount_paid_top_5_cte 

Second: 

WITH top_5_customers_cte(customer_id,first_name,last_name,country,city, total_amount_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name,E.country, D.city, SUM(A.amount) AS total_paid_amount
	from payment A
	INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
	INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
	WHERE city = 'Aurora' or city = 'Acua' or city = 'Citrus Heights' or city = 'Iwaki' or city = 'Ambattur' or city = 'Shanwei' or city = 'So Leopoldo' or city = 'Teboksary' 
	or city = 'Tianjin' or city = 'Cianjur'
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city
	ORDER BY total_paid_amount DESC
	LIMIT 5) 
SELECT D.country, COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customers_count, COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers_cte) AS top_customers_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers_cte ON A.customer_id= top_5_customers_cte.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customers_count DESC
Limit 5;
